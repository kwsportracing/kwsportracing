Located at **70292 Grand Bend Line, Grand Bend, Ontario**

KW Sport Racing is ran exclusively at Grand Bend Motorplex (Grand Bend Raceway). The excellent facility and multiple track layouts make it very welcoming and is a key factor to our decision of renting the track.

Layout is decided by poll sent to members that have pre-registered. It will then be updated on the site at the top of this page; usually 5-6 days before the event.
